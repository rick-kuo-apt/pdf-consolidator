FILE SYSTEM LOCATIONS
---------------------
Per-user settings and logs:
  %APPDATA%\PDFConsolidator\
    settings.json    - User preferences (JSON, ~1KB)
    app.log          - Diagnostic log (text, rotated)

These locations are:
  - User-writable (no admin needed)
  - Roaming profile compatible
  - Safe for folder redirection

CODE SIGNING (RECOMMENDED)
--------------------------
The distributed executable is NOT code-signed by default.
Users will see Windows SmartScreen warnings on first run.

To eliminate SmartScreen warnings:
  1. Obtain a code signing certificate (EV recommended)
  2. Sign PDFConsolidator.exe with signtool:
     signtool sign /tr http://timestamp.digicert.com /td sha256 ^
       /fd sha256 /a PDFConsolidator.exe
  3. Repackage the signed exe

Workaround without signing:
  - Users click "More info" > "Run anyway"
  - Or add to trusted publishers via Group Policy

SMARTSCREEN EXPECTATIONS
------------------------
Without code signing, users will see:
  "Windows protected your PC"
  "Windows SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app..."

This is normal for unsigned applications and does not
indicate malware. The warning appears once per user.

SECURITY FEATURES
-----------------
  - Offline only - no network calls
  - No telemetry or analytics
  - Sanitized logs (usernames redacted)
  - No secrets stored (passwords never saved)

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
1. App won't start

2. SmartScreen blocks execution
   - Right-click exe > Properties > Unblock
   - Or use Group Policy to trust the publisher

3. Antivirus false positive
