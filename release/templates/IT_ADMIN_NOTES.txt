-------------------
  - Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
  - No Python installation required
  - No admin rights required
  - ~80-150 MB disk space
  - No network access required

DEPENDENCIES
------------
  - Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable (usually pre-installed)
    If users report "VCRUNTIME140.dll not found" or similar:
    Install from: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

FILE SYSTEM LOCATIONS
---------------------

    settings.json    - User preferences (JSON, ~1KB)
    app.log          - Diagnostic log (text, auto-rotated)

WINDOWS SMARTSCREEN & ZONE BLOCKING
-----------------------------------
The executable is NOT code-signed by default.

SmartScreen Warning:
  Users will see "Windows protected your PC" on first run.
  Solution: Click "More info" > "Run anyway"

Zone Identifier (Mark of the Web):
  Files downloaded from the internet or network shares may be blocked.
  Solution: Right-click exe > Properties > check "Unblock" > Apply

  To unblock via PowerShell:
    Unblock-File -Path "C:\path\to\PDFConsolidator.exe"

  To unblock entire folder:
    Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\path\to\folder" -Recurse | Unblock-File

Group Policy Options:
  - Add to trusted publishers
  - Configure SmartScreen exceptions
  - Use AppLocker with hash rules

CODE SIGNING (Recommended)
--------------------------
To eliminate SmartScreen warnings:
  1. Obtain a code signing certificate (EV recommended)
  2. Sign PDFConsolidator.exe with signtool:
     signtool sign /tr http://timestamp.digicert.com /td sha256 ^
       /fd sha256 /a PDFConsolidator.exe
  3. Repackage the signed exe
  4. Update SHA256 hashes in release artifacts

ANTIVIRUS CONSIDERATIONS
------------------------
PyInstaller executables occasionally trigger false positives.

If flagged:
  1. Whitelist the application folder
  2. Submit to AV vendor for analysis
  3. Use hash-based allowlisting

The manifest.json in the release contains SHA256 hashes for verification.
